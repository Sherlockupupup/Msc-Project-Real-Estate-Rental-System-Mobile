# Msc-Project-Real-Estate-Rental-System-Mobile
This is the mobile terminal of Msc Project Real Estate Rental System
This is my project in MSc HKBU, coding a real estate rental system that has three roles to use the system. One is the admin that can create, manage, view and delete the houses. User can view the houses shown in the first page or search houses by filtering their requirement. They also can rent a house and delete the house. Last one is vistor that only can view the houses and search it but cannot rent because they need to login to the site. Finally, I also develop it in the mobile site by using NativeScript. But due to the time limitation and project requirement, I just use Ngrok to share the data both in Web and Mobile terminal, i.e. If I create or rent a new house, the mobile terminal will immediately obtain the new message and update it.

Can link to another one, Web terminal. "Msc-Project-Real-Estate-Rental-System-Web"
